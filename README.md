This was the first task of my internship, where I was introduced to the basics of HTML and CSS. I built a simple yet responsive landing page that includes a header with navigation links, a hero section with a heading, a short description, and a call-to-action button, followed by a footer with social media links. I used Flexbox for layout and media queries to make sure the page works well on different screen sizes. This task helped me understand how to structure a webpage and style it to be both clean and responsive, and it gave me my first hands-on experience with building real-world layouts.
